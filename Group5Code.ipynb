    "- From the 'Distraction from Social Media chart', we can see the count of people that have ratings of 4 and 5, for how easily they are distracted by Social Media, are over the 100 count mark. Contrarily, people that rated 1 and 2 are under the 90 count mark. The chart shows that a significant amount of people are easily distracted by Social Media. We will factor in age, gender, occupation, average time spent on social media, to determine if there is a an existing correlation. The ratings of 1 -5 in this section represents how easily people are distracted by social media with 1 being not at all to 5 being extremely distracted. We also found the mean distraction rating score to use it as a standard when performing statistical tests on the gender categories.\n",

    "### Does Age, Gender, Average Time Spent on Social Media, and Occupation play a role in how easily one is by social media?\n",
    "- There are no significant differences between different genders in terms of how easily they are distracted by social media. The correlation that exists between the two factors is very weak since it's close to 0. This suggests that gender is not a significant factor that contributes how easily people are distracted by social media.\n",
    "- There is a weak negative correlation between age and distraction rating which suggests that as age increases, the likelihood of being distracted decreases. \n",
    "- There is a moderate correlation that exists between average time spent on social media and how easily an individual is distracted by social media. The 'Distraction Level by Average Time Spent' bar chart shows that there is an increasing trend of higher ratings as more time is spent on social media. \n",
    "- A weak correlation exists between occupation and the distraction level which suggests that depending on the nature of occupation, the level of distraction varies. In this case, University Students tend to experience higher levels of distraction \n",
    "\n",
    "### Is there a correlation between age and the average time spent on social media based off of how easily they are distracted by social media?\n",
    "- There is almost no correlation between age and average time spent on social media for distraction depending on the correlation coefficient = 0.02. There is also an extremely high p value which suggests that the correlation itself is not significant\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is there a correlation between occupation and the average time spent on social media based off of how easily they are distracted by social media?\n",
    "- A weak negative correlation exists between these two factors. Because the correlation coefficient is at -0.1919,here is a slight tendency that people with different occupations tend to spend different times on social media \n",
    "- The heatmap 'Distraction Rating by Occupation and Average Time on Social Media' also shows that different ratings were dependent on the occupation group and average time spent. For instance, university students show a relatively consistency in their distraction ratings across the different average times spent on social media. This conclusion, shows that other groups had higher tendencies of being distracted dependent on the average time spent compared to when we were just testing against occupation and distraction. In the previous case, university students tend to have the most amount distraction without taking average time into factor."

    "- One of the findings we observed when performing statistical testing on Age and Distraction Ratings is that there is a weak negative correlation between age and distraction (-0.2192). From the 'Distraction Ratings by Age Group' line chart, we observed the patterns of each rating as age increases. In Age Groups 10-19 and 25-29 where the population was approximately similar, the results of the ratings were vastly different. People in the older age group of 25-29 were more likely to be distracted than those of belonging 10-19. As the age increases, we see that the distraction rating that represents the most amount of response for ratings decrease. Age groups 30-39 had the most amount of Distraction Ratings 2 compared to other distraction ratings and Age Groups 40-49 and 50-59 had the most ratings being at 1. This supports the  negative correlation that possibly as the age increases, the likelihood of being distracted also decreases. However we do want to take note that it is a weak correlation. \n",

    "     - The distribution among the dataset shows that a significant portion of the population are made up by people in their early 20s, specifically 58% are represented by people from ages 20-24. Since the data is skewed towards this particular age group, further testing and analysis needs to be conducted to support the findings. "

The correlation coefficient (-0.0685) showed that there was an extremely weak negative correlation between gender and distraction ratings. As the p-value was 0.1379, it supports that the correlation is not statistically significant. We also performed statistical testing that compared the results of female and male distraction ratings.

    "- The distribution across the 3 categories of average time spent on social media (0-3 hours, 3-5 hours, and 5+ hours) is more proportionate compared to the previous factors studied. The correlation coefficient at 0.29 suggests that there is a moderate positive correlation between average time spent and how easily distracted people are by social media. This suggests that there is some sort of tendency that people who spends more time on social media will experience higher levels of distraction. This is supported by the 'Distraction Level by Average Time Spent' chart, where people who spent 5+ hours on social media had the most ratings for being extremely distracted (5) where as people who spent 0-3 hours on social media had a relative uniformity across all ratings. From one group of average time spent to the next, there is an increasing trend of higher ratings as more time is spent on social media.\n",

Eenvironmental and individual differences are factors that could play a role in how easily one becomes distracted by social media.

In the case of salaried workers, distraction levels of 4 and 5 were lower than the other 3 distraction ratings compared to students.

    "- There is a weak negative correlation between occupation and average time spent on social media based on distraction ratings. Since the correlation coefficient is at -0.1919, there is a slight tendency that people with different occupations tend to spend different times on social media. Because the p-value is at 0.2623 we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the Average Time on Social Media and the Occupation. However, further testing needs to be conducted to determine different occupation impact the average time spent on social media and how distracted they are from social media based on these two factors.\n",
    "- The heatmap 'Distraction Rating by Occupation and Average Time on Social Media' portrays that retired workers have a tendency to spend more time on social media, which suggest they are more likely to be distractedby social media. However given that the population that is represented by retired workers is at 1.7%, there is too little data to suggest the accuracy of this result. On the other hand, school students and salaried workers have higher distraction ratings as they spend more time on social media. In comparison, university students show a relatively consistent distraction ratings across the different average times spent on social media. "

    "# Time Spent on social Media Vs Sleep Deprivation\n",
    "1. From the box plot \"Time spent on social media vs sleep deprivation\", We can see how the rating are increasing with the time spent on the social media, from half hour to one hour we can see the increment in the ratings, there is not much difference in one and two hours but going to three hours to 4 hours we can see huge difference in the ratings.From this chart we can infer that the more time we spend on social media,the more sleep deprived we become.As a result, the depression total score increases as we spent more time on social media. Therefore, social media does have a negative impace on mental health.' \n",
    "2. There is still a lot to consider in this project like getting the more closely distributed data, big data sets and different other factors like weather, seasons etc. If had more time to explore on this topics we could come up with other interesting analysis as well. "
