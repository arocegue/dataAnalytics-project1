This repository contains a data science and machine learning project that aims to investigate the potential correlation between the amount of time an individual spends on social media and the impact it has on their mental health.

The project involves conducting a survey to collect data, organizing the data, and using machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that can determine whether a person should seek professional help based on their answers to the survey questions.

This project was completed as part of a Statistics course at a university, and the team is currently in the process of writing a report and completing a paper that summarizes and discusses the findings in relation to other research on the topic.
